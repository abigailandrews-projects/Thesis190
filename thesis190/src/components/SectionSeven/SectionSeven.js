      COVID was bringing out a more vicious side of the thief. They convinced
      several translators to write reports on manuscripts in various languages,
      promising to pay $150 per book, then ghosting the translators once the
      work was done, an attack on some of the field’s lowest-paid people. There
      was no telling who they might go after next.

    <div className={style.container}>
      In late April of this year, a scout named Liz Gately, whom I had recently
      interviewed, received an email from the thief impersonating another scout
      named Bettina Schrewe:
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      <div className={style.email}>
        Dear Liz,<br /><br />
        Someone named Reeves Wiedeman contacted me to talk about the
        publishing scammer and he said you gave him my name. Who is he? Do you
        know him? Is he someone legit? <br /><br />
        Best, <br />
        Bettina
    </div>
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      The email wasn’t accurate. Gately hadn’t given me Schrewe’s name. How did
      the thief know I was on the case? I had spoken to more than 50 people in
      publishing, some of whom were suspects themselves. And earlier that week,
      I had emailed with Mira Trenchard, the scout whose inbox had seemingly
      been compromised. However they knew, the thief was aware of my efforts and
      reached out directly a day later:
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      <div className={style.email}>
        Hi Reeves, <br /><br />
        We might know who the phisher is! Apparently a few days ago he
        sent an email asking for a manuscript but he forgot to sign with the
        agent/victim’s name and put his own …<br /><br />
        Best,<br />
        Bettina
    </div>
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      Even in my heightened state of alertness, I had to scrutinize the phony
      email address several times to see that the “r” and “h” in Schrewe had
      been swapped. I called Lila to workshop a response. Should we let the
      thief know we were onto them? Or play along?
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      We chose the latter. “It definitely makes me feel anxious,” Fake Bettina
      wrote back when I asked about the effect of the ongoing scheme. (She said
      that she had recently heard that “the phisher got hold of an early draft
      of Taffy Brodesser-Akner’s new novel from the production department at PRH
      here in NY.”) Fake Bettina declined to say anything over email about the
      name in question, other than to note that it was a common one. She wanted
      to print the damning email and send it via FedEx; when I suggested our
      company mailroom, she said the material was too sensitive for that. Could
      we provide a home address? “I’ll pay the postage of course,” the thief
      wrote.
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      After a brief silence — when I followed up several days later, my email
      bounced back — the thief returned wearing a new costume. Now impersonating
      a Dutch editor, they sent four different emails: one each to my personal
      and work accounts and to Lila’s. Each was a warped but nearly identical
      version of the others. Three of the four cut off mid-sentence; one ended
      in the middle of a word, reading in full:
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      <div className={style.email}>
        Dear Reeves,<br /><br />
        I heard you’re working on an article on the publishing
        scammer and I w
      </div>
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      What on earth was going on? I continued to play dumb, still hoping to
      glean something revelatory. But the thief quickly dismissed all of this as
      pointless. “It’s stupid and ridiculous,” the thief wrote. “Only a waste of
      time.”
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      Was the thief referring to our investigation, I asked, or the caper
      itself?
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      “The third option,” they wrote. I asked what they meant. “It’s only a
      publicity stunt set up by the Publishers and Editors Association,” the
      thief said, citing an organization that doesn’t exist. “They’re fooling
      you.”
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      As the conversation stretched over several days, other strange things
      occurred. The thief impersonated my book agent for the first time.
      Anonymous accounts tried to connect with me on LinkedIn. One morning, I
      woke up to an overnight alert on my phone that someone was trying to log
      in to an online dating profile that had not been active for years.
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      Lila, meanwhile, had begun her own exchange with the thief. Our approaches
      diverged. While I was happy to methodically collect emails, hoping the
      next exchange would provide a case-breaking clue, Lila was eight months
      pregnant, and every time she returned from a doctor’s appointment, she
      grew more exasperated at my increasingly chaotic Homeland wall.
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      She wanted to be more direct. “Would you be up for a phone call?” she
      wrote to the thief. The thief suggested an in-person meeting instead. When
      Lila said she lived in Brooklyn, the thief said they did, too. Lila then
      suggested meeting in Cobble Hill, at which point the conversation turned.
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      “How about Fuck You Hill?” the thief wrote back. “Or can I meet you at
      Silly Cunt Square?”
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      The message went on. “TAKE MY ADVICE,” the thief wrote. “DROP THIS STUPID
      ARTICLE AND STOP WITH IT IMMEDIATELY!!!”
    </div>
  </>
