      While riding the TGV from Paris to Germany in October 2018, a scout I’ll
      call Natasha — she requested a pseudonym in order to more freely discuss
      industry spywork — sent an excited email to her clients. A few days
      earlier, she had received a message from a scout named Jane Southern
      offering a trade. Southern had Ian McEwan’s new novel, Machines Like Me,
      and said she would slip it to Natasha, perhaps in exchange for another big
      release.
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      Scouts don’t often swap manuscripts, which amounts to giving intelligence
      to the enemy, but this was an unusual case. The foreign rights to a title
      by a big-name writer like McEwan are spoken for well in advance, which
      made the book less valuable to Southern’s clients around the world.
      Natasha, however, was among a growing number of scouts who work
      exclusively on behalf of Hollywood producers and studios, and the film
      rights to a new McEwan could be snatched up fresh each time. The book
      would be a trophy for Natasha to show her clients as she arrived at the
      Frankfurt Book Fair, international publishing’s Davos, and she was
      especially grateful to Southern for the offer because they had never met
      in person. Natasha saw Southern at a dinner and thanked her for the slip.

    <div className={style.container}>
      Southern had no idea what she was talking about.

    <div className={style.container}>
      After a quiet summer, the thief was back with a new tactic. They didn’t
      just want the McEwan. The McEwan was bait. And if the thief were trading
      in books that were of great interest to Hollywood, the money involved
      might change the risk-reward calculus for a scout. Studios and production
      companies depend on their film scouts for early access to books in order
      to start wooing a director and identifying star-worthy roles that would
      make for an enticing package. Maria Campbell, the scouting world’s biggest
      player, made her name in part by getting Michael Crichton’s Jurassic Park
      in front of Steven Spielberg; today, she scouts for Netflix. The thief’s
      earliest emails hit just as the streaming wars began and the hunger for
      content with a built-in audience ramped up. A producer landing early
      access from the thief would still need to buy the rights through proper
      channels, but a head start would make them ready to pounce when the time
      came.
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      The thief did possess a tenacity more common in Hollywood than the book
      world. If a target didn’t respond, the thief would often follow up with an
      identical request several hours later. One person received nine emails
      from the thief in a single day. Some insiders speculated the thief was
      servicing multiple Hollywood clients — scouts, producers, studios — none
      of whom knew, or wanted to know, where the material was coming from.
      “Maybe it’s another level down,” one literary agent whispered. “A
      subcontracted service.”
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      By the fall of 2018, the thief had made off with dozens of books, although
      no one knew how many times people had fallen for the scam, so the total
      haul was likely much higher. A literary agent in New York didn’t realize
      until this summer, when I helped her look through her inbox, that for
      seven months she had been sending manuscripts to the thief, rather than a
      scout she thought was simply dying to read her books.
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      Several people decided it was time to ask for outside help. A scout broke
      the news to The Bookseller, a British trade publication, and Publishers
      Weekly spoke to Ziv Lewis, who works for an Israeli publisher and said
      that he had threatened the thief with “Mossad-style cyberwarfare.” Erin
      Edmison, a scout in New York, even approached someone at the state
      attorney general’s office, only to be told that the potential for criminal
      rather than civil charges, not to mention the jurisdictional quagmire —
      how do you prosecute someone impersonating a Romanian asking a Swede for
      an American novel? — meant she might be better off trying the FBI.
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      To many in the industry, the case felt like one that book people, having
      sold no shortage of spy novels, could solve on their own. “There’s a bunch
      of us amateur Nancy Drews and Hardy Boys who have made our versions of the
      Claire Danes Homeland wall,” said Baker, the scout. In the spring of 2019,
      Baker conducted a sting. After the thief emailed a European client asking
      for Of Women and Salt, one of the season’s hottest novels, Baker mocked up
      a PDF with the book’s cover page — followed by the text of Pride and
      Prejudice. Baker told his client to slip the Austen mash-up to the thief
      and then alerted others to their plan. If the thief was a scout, Baker
      hoped, they would unwittingly send the fake book to their clients. But the
      PDF never turned up. Others tried similar gambits to no avail.
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      Three years into the crime spree, an industry based on trust and
      relationships faced a growing paranoia. Agencies started
      password-protecting minor books. (“I got a 70-page Dutch novella with an
      NDA,” one scout said. “An NDA for a 70-page Dutch novella!”) A scout and
      an agent developed a code word they included in emails to authenticate
      their conversations. People were suddenly distrustful of colleagues they
      had worked with for years.
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      The attacks felt personal. It was violating to men and women of letters to
      have their words appropriated — especially once authors themselves became
      targets. Many writers were vulnerable to the ruse, eager to please someone
      they thought was their agent or editor. Others experienced it as yet
      another letdown. The thief reached out to an Icelandic author, expressing
      interest in representing that person’s work abroad, only to disappear with
      their manuscript.
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      In 2019, the thief found out that Eka Kurniawan, an Indonesian novelist
      who was nominated for the Man Booker International Prize, had a deadline
      looming and decided to impersonate his agent. “You told me the manuscript
      would be ready before the 18th of July and it’s now the 14th,” the thief
      wrote, applying pressure on Kurniawan to hand over the draft. Kurniawan is
      now two years late, and his agent, Maria Cardona, said the stress was
      partly responsible. “He’s been quite stuck,” she said.
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      Multiple people told me they were convinced the thief was someone they
      knew pursuing a personal vendetta. But the breadth of the scheme suggested
      a grudge against the entire industry — perhaps an underling whose career
      hadn’t panned out was spoiling a party they weren’t invited to. A few
      months after his foiled sting, Baker sent a snarky reply to the thief in
      which he concocted another fake book. “There’s a new submission over here
      that’s the talk of the town,” Baker wrote. The book, he said, was called
      Anatomy of a Fraud. Baker told the thief it was “epistolary, a series of
      email exchanges.” The thief’s response suggested they were either
      oblivious to the innuendo or taking a sly delight in the chaos they were
      creating. They asked, “Can you share the MS pls?”
