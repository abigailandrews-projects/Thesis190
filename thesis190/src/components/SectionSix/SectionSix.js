      The pandemic disrupted the book business just like everything else. The
      only constant was email, and the thief took advantage. After learning that
      a British agent had contracted the virus, the thief emailed the agent’s
      assistant — “[He] told me he has caught COVID, jeez, that’s awful!” — to
      ask if the assistant might have Joshua Ferris’s new novel. The thief began
      sending intra-office messages between colleagues who could no longer see
      each other face-to-face and buttered up targets by asking the difficult
      questions facing publishing’s elite: “Are you staying in the city now or
      have you gone upstate?” In another message, the thief explained that
      speaking on the phone was out of the question because they were only
      working European mornings before taking over child-care duty in the
      afternoon. To their victims around the world, the thief expressed empathy:
    </div>
    {/* TODO Email */}
    <div className={style.container}>
      “I hope the situation is getting better in Norway!” “Are you in Italy now?
      I heard things are now opening up there which is great!!” “How’s working
      from home for you? For me it’s getting a bit stressful …”
    </div>

    <div className={style.container}>
      For most of the pandemic, the thief’s scheme looked like a game, a way to
      pass the time. During the height of lockdown restrictions in London, the
      thief impersonated a U.K. scout to ask for Kevin Kwan’s forthcoming sequel
      to Crazy Rich Asians. “I’d like to take a look at it over the weekend,”
      the thief wrote. “Getting bored here.”
    </div>

    <div className={style.container}>
      I was getting bored, too, and had to admit the investigation had become a
      welcome distraction from the state of the world. Every day brought a new
      domain to investigate, and I now had my own version of the Homeland wall:
      a spreadsheet filled with 400 of the thief’s emails and counting,
      organized into dozens of categories I hoped would reveal something before
      the scheme swallowed me whole.
    </div>

    <div className={style.container}>
      I did find one unusual sequence of events. During the third week of last
      August, the thief seemed to snap. It was six months into the pandemic, and
      for the first time I could see, they were angry. On multiple occasions
      that week, they emailed literary agents threatening to leak unpublished
      manuscripts they claimed to already have unless the agents handed over
      another book the thief was after. In several cases, they pasted text from
      the manuscripts they had in order to make the threat real. They signed one
      such email “xxx.”
    </div>

    <div className={style.container}>
      The most menacing message came on August 17. Linda Altrov Berg, who had
      dealt with the “Millennium” attack back in 2017, received an email
      impersonating an editor in Spain, asking for a book that Altrov Berg
      instantly knew that particular editor would never want. The thief, it
      seemed, didn’t actually know her world all that well. Altrov Berg sent a
      defiant reply: “Keep on dreaming!”
    </div>

    <div className={style.container}>
      In the past, the thief had retreated from confrontations, skulking back
      into the digital shadows once the jig was up. This time, however, they
      shot back a reply: “Hoppas att du dör av coronaviruset.”
    </div>
    <div className={style.container}>
      In English, the message translated to: “Hope you die of the coronavirus.”
    </div>
