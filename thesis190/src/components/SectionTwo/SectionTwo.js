      This was a setup Stieg Larsson would have admired: a clever thief adopting
      multiple aliases, targeting victims around the world, and acting with no
      clear motive. The manuscripts weren’t being pirated, as far as anyone
      could tell. Fake Francesca wasn’t demanding a ransom. “We assumed it was
      the Russians,” Mörk said. “But we are the book industry. It’s not like
      we’re digging gold or researching vaccines.” Perhaps someone in
      publishing, or a Hollywood producer, was desperate for early access to
      books they might buy. Was the thief simply an impatient reader? A
      strung-out writer in need of ideas? “In the hacker culture that Stieg
      Larsson depicted, they do a lot of things not for financial benefit,” Mörk
      pointed out this spring, “but just to show that they can do it.”

      When I first heard about the scheme in February, four years after the
      attempted “Millennium” heist, the thief was still on the loose, exhibiting
      behavior that was even bolder and more bizarre as they chased after
      everything from Sally Rooney’s latest to novels by obscure writers never
      published in English before. This sounded like a fun challenge, a digital
      mystery to obsess over at a time when the real world was shut down. I
      texted a friend in publishing to find out more. She quickly replied, “The
      culprit has been identified.” This was unexpected. The New York Times had
      two reporters on the case last year, and the FBI had been called in to
      investigate, but no charges or accusations had been leveled publicly. One
      of my colleagues, Lila Shapiro, looked into the scam in 2019 but dropped
      the story after concluding the case might be too baffling to crack. Many
      in publishing were too paranoid to discuss it. One literary agent, who had
      become obsessed with solving the mystery, had declined to talk because she
      feared Lila herself might be the thief.

      And yet my contact was certain — or “like 85 percent sure” — that the
      thief was a particular person, a man who had worked in New York publishing
      for a decade. He was an outsider in the industry with a reputation for
      becoming pushy when he didn’t get what he wanted. He seemed to conduct his
      business almost entirely over email.

      Even more intriguing: Someone, I was told, had proof.
